== What is a package in Java?

We can think of different folders in our computer as a package in Java.
More formally, from the oracle documentation: "A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces."

== Some Points

01. When we are creating a Java class inside a package we need to mention package name at the top of that class.
e.g. `package mypackage.controller`

02. Nested packages are seperated by dots while importing.

== Importance of Java Package

01. Improves maintainability and enhance coding structure.
02. Allows us same class name in different packages.s
03. Helps us to maintain accessibility of different classes.
We will see how public, private, protected etc. can be used to control access.
